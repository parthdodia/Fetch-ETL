1. How will you read messages from the queue?
- Use the awslocal command to read messages from the SQS queue.
- Use the boto3 library to interact with the SQS queue programmatically.

2. What type of data structures should be used? 
- Use Python dictionaries to store and manipulate the JSON data.
- Use a data structure like pandas DataFrame to handle and transform the data.

3. How will you mask the PII data so that duplicate values can be identified? 
- Use a hashing algorithm like SHA-256 to create a unique, irreversible hash for each PII value.
- Use a encryption algorithm like AES to encrypt the PII values, with a key stored securely.

4. What will be your strategy for connecting and writing to Postgres? 
- Use the psycopg2 library to connect to Postgres and execute SQL queries.

5. Where and how will your application run? 
- Run the application on a local machine using Docker Compose.
- Run the application on a cloud platform like AWS, using a container service like ECS or Fargate.

6. How would you deploy this application in production? 
- Use a CI/CD pipeline tool like Jenkins or CircleCI to automate deployment.
- Use a cloud platform's built-in deployment features, like AWS CodeDeploy or Google Cloud Deploy.

7. What other components would you want to add to make this production ready? 
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for message processing.
- Add security features like authentication and authorization for access to the application.

8. How can this application scale with a growing dataset? 
- Implement horizontal scaling by adding more instances of the application.
- Use a cloud platform's auto-scaling features to dynamically adjust instance count.

9. How can PII be recovered later on? 
- Store the original PII values in a secure, encrypted storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
- Implement a secure, audited process for recovering PII values, with access controls and logging.

10. What are the assumptions you made? 
- Assumed that the SQS queue will always be available, and messages will not be lost.
- Assumed that the Postgres database will always be available and writable.
- Assumed that the PII data will always be properly masked and secured.
