#  ETL off a SQS Queue

This project aims to develop a scalable and secure solution to read messages from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue, mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, and store the masked data in a PostgreSQL database. The solution should be able to handle a growing dataset and ensure data integrity and security.
